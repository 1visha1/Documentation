About This Project
  Overview
    Welcome to automating the deployment process of nodeJs application !
    This open-source project 
    aims to aims to streamline development workflows through CI/CD automation,
    Dockerized deployments, community collaboration,
    and reliable testing practices,
    fostering a vibrant and inclusive environment for contributors worldwide


  Key Features
    Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
      We leverage Jenkins for automating the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring a streamlined development workflow.
    Dockerized Deployment:
      The project utilizes Docker to containerize the Node.js application, allowing for consistent and scalable deployment across various environments.
    GitHub Integration:   
      Our project is hosted on GitHub, enabling collaborative development and version control. 
      We have implemented webhooks to trigger automated builds upon commits to the main branch.

  How It Works
    Source Code Management: 
      The project source code is hosted on [GitHub Repository Link]. 
      Jenkins is configured to clone the repository, keeping the development environment up-to-date.
    Automated Testing: 
      As part of the CI/CD pipeline, the project runs automated tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
      Developers can also contribute by adding test cases to enhance the testing suite.
    Docker Image Creation: 
      The Dockerfile defines the environment for our Node.
      js application. 
      Jenkins builds a Docker image, encapsulating the application and its dependencies.
    Deployment to Docker Hub: 
      The Docker image is pushed to [https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vishalshekokar999749/node-app-test-new/], allowing for centralized storage and distribution.
    Deployment to EC2 Instances: 
      A deployment script facilitates the deployment of the Docker image to EC2 instances.
      This ensures seamless deployment to our production environment.
